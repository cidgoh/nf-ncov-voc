D1118H		S	T cell evasion			 Reynolds et al. (2021) 	 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282	 Mutation is predicted to lose the T cell epitope for people carrying DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401,  but not for example in those who are DRB1*0701 or DRB1*1501 who would be predicted to show an enhanced response.

E484K		S	T cell evasion			 Reynolds et al.

The mutation appeared  to have no substantial or differential impact on T cell responses.
N501Y		S	T cell evasion			 Reynolds et al. (2021) 	 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282	 Vaccinated, but not post-infection sera, show decreased average T cell response to an N501Y peptide. When we primed transgenic mice expressing human HLA-DRB1*0401 with the Wuhan Hu-1 peptide pool,  T cell responses to the B.1.1.7 variant peptide pool were significantly reduced (p = 0.0286).  Furthermore, the T cell response to the spike N501Y mutation common to all three of the current VOC was ablated.

S13I		S	antibody epitope effects			 McCallum et al. (2021) 	 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925v1	 The S13I mutation dampened binding of 5 mAbs and abrogated binding of 5 additional mAbs out of 11 neutralizing mAbs evaluated. Predicted to shift the signal peptide cleavage site from S13-Q14 to C15-V16, which can affect NTD conformation.  PG: in saying S12F does not shift the signal peptide nor affect mAb binding, this manuscript appears to contradict the  text of McCallum et al.'s earlier 2021 manuscript stating that S12F *does* affected some mAb binding via putative signal peptide shift.

N501Y		S	antibody epitope effects			 Klegerman et al. (2021) 	 https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.26.441517	 Contrary to other reports on N501Y containing lineages (i.e. with additional mutations), N501Y alone may have an even greater affinity for a human monoclonal antibody specific for wild type. These results suggest that the individual N501Y mutation does not contribute to altered viral properties by itself, but may contribute to a collective conformational shift produced by multiple mutations.

This finding shows that the  increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501  mutant residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.

Luciferase activity was measured two days postinfection,  showing major decrease in infection rate amongst the cells, hence this individual variant  is unlikely to contribute to cell entry fitness. T716I was expressed at significantly lower level, accounting for the decreased infectivity of this spike protein. This property may be specific to spike protein biosynthesis in 293T cells and is not likely to reflect the situation in vivo given the reported increase in infectivity of the B.1.1.7 virus.

D614G		S	trafficking			 Zhang et l. (2020) 	 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19808-4	 We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than wild type (~9-fold).  This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.  D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may  increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.

D614G		S	trafficking			 Daniloski et al. (2021) 	 https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.65365	 The increased transduction with Spike D614G ranged from 1.3- to 2.4-fold in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells expressing  endogenous ACE2 and from 1.5- to 7.7-fold in A549ACE2 and Huh7.5ACE2 overexpressing ACE2.  Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the D614 and G614 Spike variants,  the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.

M85del	M85del	NSP1	immunosuppression variant emergence			 Avanzato et al. (2020) 	 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7640888/	 Emergent as 22% variant by day 70 post-infection of female immunocompromised  individual with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia.  Variant became 100% in day 70 culture. Variant disappeared after convalescent plasma treatment (day 71) in subsequent patient sample sequencing.
I82T		M	homoplasy			 Shen et al. (2021) 	 https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1922097	 This mutation presents mainly within the B.1 (44.0%) and B.1.525 (38.1%) lineages.  Currently, 99.7% of the B.1.525 lineage isolates carry the M:I82T mutation. While this mutation is scattered across multiple  phylogenetic clades, most cases cluster in two recent clades, suggesting a likely selective advantage in certain haplotype backgrounds.

R95X		N	stress granule inhibition			 Cai et al. (2021) 	 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.24.436822v1	 Stress granules (SGs) are ephermeral cellular structures that temporarily place mRNAs in a translationally inactive state while cells are stress.   Not surprisingly, viruses can modulate SG formation in infected cells through interactions with SG effector proteins. Methylation of N protein at R95 causes the suppression of SG formation through host-protein interactions.

Two of 13 vaccinated versus 4 of 5  non-vaccinated residents presented severe disease. BNT162b2 did not prevent the outbreak, but reduced  transmission and disease severity. Among the 13 fully vaccinated residents who were infected, 2 (15.4%) presented with an asymptomatic disease, 9 (69.2%) developed mild to moderate symptoms, and 2 (15.4%) progressed to severe disease with fatal evolution secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There was no relationship between anti-S antibody levels at diagnosis and disease severity. Overall, the proportion of residents with severe disease in the non-vaccinated group (4/5)  was higher than that in the vaccinated group (2/13).

There was no relationship between anti-S antibody levels at diagnosis and disease severity. Overall, the proportion of residents with severe disease in the non-vaccinated group (4/5)  was higher than that in the vaccinated group (2/13).

Those who were vaccinated and went on to have symptoms had a 44%  lower risk of being admitted hospital and a 51% lower risk of death compared with people who were unvaccinated. We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.

Those who were vaccinated and went on to have symptoms had a 44%  lower risk of being admitted hospital and a 51% lower risk of death compared with people who were unvaccinated. We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.

We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.

The two physicians  were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine, with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG  anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a  common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who  required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment (PPE).

This was an average of a 2-fold increase, relative to sera drawn from the  individuals who received one dose of vaccination—mean NT50 dilution of 51,300. Importantly, a 6-fold increase in mean NT50 dilution was  obtained when sera from the first vaccination dose was compared to convalescent sera from cohort with severe disease (NT50 51,000 vs 8,700)  21 to 63 days post-onset.

Patients were 56 and 58yo, immunocompenent, with one a former smoker with obesity and dyslipidemia. One case required intubation during first infection,  but presented with mild symptoms upon reinfection. The other case convalesced at home during the first episode, but required CPAP support  in the subacute clinical unit upon reinfection.
